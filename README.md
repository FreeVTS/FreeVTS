# FreeVTS
This is the repository of the unique, free VTS

The aim of this project is to build the software portion of a free, opensource, IALA compliant, VTS. At first, this project will be more focused on a VTS for harbour or port operation, since we think that it is more easy to be worldly adopted by many small port or owned by country with less ressources. We will also try to design this VTS for that it can be used by non-profit organisations, such as those involved in environnement issues.

Your thoughts, comments, suggestion are all welcomed and also your help if you want to be involved in this great project.
